==========
Here is a plugins suite for efficient work in Sketch.App. The purpose is to work faster and less apish.


# Text Leading Up/Down and LineSpacing Up/Down
Let you manipulate with text block leading and line spacing via keyboard. With native hotkeys for font size (cmd alt =/-) and text block size changing (cmd shift ←/→) it transforms Sketch into typographics tool with immediate connection.

# Keep only text layers in selection
It removes any layers except text from your current selection. Sometimes you will want to choose all text layers in the document, page or artboard. So select all layers of scope you want and apply this plugin.


# Random shift
Shifts layers in selection in random direction. It’ll ask you for maximum shift size.

# Random size
Gives to layers in selection random size based on Perlin noise. It’ll ask you for scale factor.
