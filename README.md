![Text manipulations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x-raizor/Efficiency/master/demo/text_manipulation.gif)
Let you manipulate with text block leading, line spacing and tracking via keyboard. With native hotkeys for font size (cmd alt =/-) and text block size changing (cmd shift ←/→) it transforms Sketch into typographics tool with immediate connection.

## Keyboard shortcuts
* Leading+: command alt shift ctrl =
* Leading-: command alt shift ctrl -
* Line Spacing+: command alt shift =
* Line Spacing-: command alt shift -
* Tracking-: Alt ← 
* Tracking+: Alt →

# Text tracking
Press Alt ← or Alt → to decrease or increase symbols spacing (tracking). It works only then text frame selected not in edit mode.


# Keep only text layers in selection
It removes any layers except text from your current selection. Sometimes you will want to choose all text layers in the document, page or artboard. So select all layers of scope you want and apply this plugin.


# Random shift
Shifts layers in selection in random direction. It’ll ask you for maximum shift size.

# Random size
Gives to layers in selection random size based on Perlin noise. It’ll ask you for scale factor.
